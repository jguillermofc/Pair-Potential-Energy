This repository contains a companion notebook for the paper titled with the same name. For readability, the notebook 
can be considered as supplementary material for **Section 3.2.2. Predicting $\alpha$**. 

The $\alpha$ parameter is the most critical one in the study of pair-potential energy functions since it 
controls the rate of decrease of the kernels. Hence, it directly influences the overall pair-potential energy 
of the Pareto front approximation which impacts its diversity. In this repository, we provide a DNN to determine 
how to set $\alpha$ to generate the Pareto front approximations that adequately represent the underlying manifold.
